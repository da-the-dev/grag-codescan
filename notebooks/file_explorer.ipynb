    "You are tasked with explaining to a principal software engineer how to draw the best and most accurate system design diagram / architecture of a given project. This explanation should be tailored to the specific project's purpose and structure. To accomplish this, you will be provided with two key pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The complete and entire file tree of the project including all directory and file names, which will be enclosed in <file_tree> tags in the users message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The README file of the project, which will be enclosed in <readme> tags in the users message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze these components carefully, as they will provide crucial information about the project's structure and purpose. Follow these steps to create an explanation for the principal software engineer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the project type and purpose:\n",
    "   - Examine the file structure and README to determine if the project is a full-stack application, an open-source tool, a compiler, or another type of software imaginable.\n",
    "   - Look for key indicators in the README, such as project description, features, or use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyze the file structure:\n",
    "   - Pay attention to top-level directories and their names (e.g., \"frontend\", \"backend\", \"src\", \"lib\", \"tests\").\n",
    "   - Identify patterns in the directory structure that might indicate architectural choices (e.g., MVC pattern, microservices).\n",
    "   - Note any configuration files, build scripts, or deployment-related files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examine the README for additional insights:\n",
    "   - Look for sections describing the architecture, dependencies, or technical stack.\n",
    "   - Check for any diagrams or explanations of the system's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Based on your analysis, explain how to create a system design diagram that accurately represents the project's architecture. Include the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. Identify the main components of the system (e.g., frontend, backend, database, building, external services).\n",
    "   b. Determine the relationships and interactions between these components.\n",
    "   c. Highlight any important architectural patterns or design principles used in the project.\n",
    "   d. Include relevant technologies, frameworks, or libraries that play a significant role in the system's architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Provide guidelines for tailoring the diagram to the specific project type:\n",
    "   - For a full-stack application, emphasize the separation between frontend and backend, database interactions, and any API layers.\n",
    "   - For an open-source tool, focus on the core functionality, extensibility points, and how it integrates with other systems.\n",
    "   - For a compiler or language-related project, highlight the different stages of compilation or interpretation, and any intermediate representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Instruct the principal software engineer to include the following elements in the diagram:\n",
    "   - Clear labels for each component\n",
    "   - Directional arrows to show data flow or dependencies\n",
    "   - Color coding or shapes to distinguish between different types of components\n",

      "   - The separation between API and core logic demonstrates a clean and maintainable architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "d. Include relevant technologies, frameworks, or libraries that play a significant role in the system's architecture:\n",
      "   - FastAPI for building the API layer\n",

      "   - Show how the core logic and plugins interact with each other and how they process incoming tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, provide guidelines for creating the diagram:\n",
      "   - Label each component clearly (e.g., API Layer, Tesseract Plugin, Text Processing Module)\n",
      "   - Use directional arrows to show data flow or dependencies between components.\n",
      "   - Color coding or shapes can be used to distinguish between different types of components (e.g., rectangles for modules, ellipses for plugins).\n",
