This explanation should be tailored to the specific project's purpose and structure. To accomplish this, you will be provided with two key pieces of information:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Identify the project type and purpose:\n",
    "   - Examine the file structure and README to determine if the project is a full-stack application, an open-source tool, a compiler, or another type of software imaginable.\n",
    "   - Look for key indicators in the README, such as project description, features, or use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyze the file structure:\n",
    "   - Pay attention to top-level directories and their names (e.g., \"frontend\", \"backend\", \"src\", \"lib\", \"tests\").\n",
    "   - Identify patterns in the directory structure that might indicate architectural choices (e.g., MVC pattern, microservices).\n",
    "   - Note any configuration files, build scripts, or deployment-related files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examine the README for additional insights:\n",

    "   - For a full-stack application, emphasize the separation between frontend and backend, database interactions, and any API layers.\n",
    "   - For an open-source tool, focus on the core functionality, extensibility points, and how it integrates with other systems.\n",
    "   - For a compiler or language-related project, highlight the different stages of compilation or interpretation, and any intermediate representations.\n",

    "   - Color coding or shapes to distinguish between different types of components\n",

Let's create a system design diagram tailored to this specific project:\n",

      "         - External Services (Tesseract OCR and Whisper, among others)\n",
      "\n",
      "     2. Relationships and Interactions:\n",
      "         - The user interacts with the API to send audio files for processing.\n",
      "         - The backend processes the audio files using appropriate plugins based on the file's language or user input.\n",

      "         - The processed data is stored in a database, and the API returns the results to the user.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     4. Technologies and Libraries:\n",
      "         - Python as the primary programming language.\n",
      "         - FastAPI or Flask (based on the presence of v1, router.py, auth, comparison modules) for building the API server.\n",
      "         - SQLite or another lightweight database (based on the configuration files) for data storage.\n",
      "         - Plugins using various libraries like OpenCV, PyAudio, and EasyOCR for text recognition and speech synthesis tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "     5. Tailoring the Diagram:\n",
      "         - Emphasize the modular design of the plugins system and their interactions with external services.\n",
      "         - Show how data flows through the processing pipeline, from audio files to text recognition, translation, and storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "   To create an accurate and detailed system design diagram for this project, follow these guidelines:\n",
      "      - Clearly label each component in the diagram (API server, core functionalities, plugins, database, external services).\n",
      "      - Use directional arrows to show data flow or dependencies between components (e.g., audio files flowing into the API server, which then processes them using appropriate plugins and sends results back to the user).\n",
      "      - Distinguish between different types of components by using color coding or shapes (e.g., rectangles for modules, arrows for data flow).\n",

    "- In Mermaid.js syntax, we cannot include special characters for nodes without being inside quotes! For example: `EX[/api/process (Backend)]:::api` and `API -->|calls Process()| Backend` are two examples of syntax errors. They should be `EX[\"/api/process (Backend)\"]:::api` and `API -->|\"calls Process()\"| Backend` respectively. Notice the quotes. This is extremely important. Make sure to include quotes for any string that contains special characters.\n",
    "- In Mermaid.js syntax, you cannot apply a class style directly within a subgraph declaration. For example: `subgraph \"Frontend Layer\":::frontend` is a syntax error. However, you can apply them to nodes within the subgraph. For example: `Example[\"Example Node\"]:::frontend` is valid, and `class Example1,Example2 frontend` is valid.\n",
    "- In Mermaid.js syntax, there cannot be spaces in the relationship label names. For example: `A -->| \"example relationship\" | B` is a syntax error. It should be `A -->|\"example relationship\"| B` \n",
    "- In Mermaid.js syntax, you cannot give subgraphs an alias like nodes. For example: `subgraph A \"Layer A\"` is a syntax error. It should be `subgraph \"Layer A\"` \n",
